# communal_stories
communal story telling repo.  currently a template/proof of concept, not actual story

## Inspiration
+ huge internet communities discussing/breaking down/critiquing every inch of popular stories
+ things like Marvel universe show - people crave having fan ideas come to life (a lot of them are REALLY good!)
+ people worry about/can get obsessed with what's cannon or not - branching can track that for whatever flavor of a universe you'd like
+ franchising is showing us that people love the worlds stories show, not just the individual stories, and are hungry for other stories from those *worlds*
  + people exhausted that nostalgia doesn't make new stories or expand worlds - mostly just reboots and callbacks
+ people get obsessed with *premises*, with the whole story arc most of the time ultimately becoming disappointing
+ game of thrones/netflix/hbo effect - when something gets successful, creator gets lazy/distracted/fame and wealth poisoned, and the product disintegrates into the same great-man-power-is-evil navel gazing
+ the lazy thing is to make the story about a few invincible black-and-white heroes, rather than a rich person making human decisions in a rich world
  + not because bad people, but because creating a tight world is *hard*
+ inspo from the gaming modding + patching culture
  + a story can be fixed, but the modding + patching (expanding and editing of the story universe) can grow and continue on indefinitely

## What
+ the internet crowd sources fan theories, alternate endings, proposed lore/world building/character building often *after* a section of a story comes out
  + this discussion is often very good!
+ stories often start on a strong premise, and then crap out at some point
  + we can catch these flaws and continually improve
    + sew up plotholes
    + add motivation
    + add larger societal context for motivation
    + piece dropped "clues" from earlier sections together
    + rewind plot killers that jump sharks for near-term payoffs at the expense of a greater story
+ follow a release -> feedback -> re-release pattern
  + branch "owners" always the one to 
+ gives a path from fandom to cannon, while still keeping the story in the hands of the story-teller
  + can branch off into other main story tellers through forks
+ can organize feedback cleanly and neaty with issues!
  + bugs -> plot holes
  + enhancements -> lore
  + features -> extra scenes
  + extra characters?
  + extra motivations?
  + proposed roll-backs?
+ if bold, can fork and submit a PR, which essentially becomes a fandom discussion of plot editing, ultimately up to the owner of the branch to integrate or not
+ allows for highly non-linear story telling, moving the idea of story telling from franchising to communal world-building
  + these worlds can have as many characters, side plots, politics, whatever as the community so pleases!
